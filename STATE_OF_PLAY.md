# Parking Operations System - State of Play

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026  
**Version:** 0.0.1

## Executive Summary

The Parking Operations System (POS) is a multi-site, multi-client ANPR-based parking management platform built with NestJS (backend) and React (frontend). The system processes vehicle movements, evaluates parking compliance, and manages enforcement workflows with human-in-the-loop review.

### Current Status: **Active Development**

The system has a solid foundation with core functionality implemented, but several features require completion and testing before production readiness.

- **Decision Updates:** No mechanism to update decisions when new data arrives

### ❌ Enforcement Lifecycle
- **Batch Archival:** No enforcement packaging/archival
- **Export Functionality:** No export to external systems
- **Lifecycle States:** Limited status tracking (missing EXPORTED, CLOSED states)

### ❌ Client Isolation

- **Client Portal:** Separate client-facing system not built

### ❌ Advanced Features
- **Barrier Integration:** Not implemented
- **Occupancy Tracking:** Not implemented
- **Appeals/Disputes:** Not implemented
- **Evidence Integrity:** Basic image storage only

### ❌ Production Readiness
- **Environment Configuration:** `.env.example` exists but needs documentation

- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling, needs enhancement
- **Logging:** Basic NestJS logging, needs structured logging
- **Monitoring:** No health checks or metrics endpoints
- **Port Management:** No port cleanup on startup (user requirement)

---

## Known Issues / TODOs

### Code TODOs
1. **Payment Time Window Check** (`src/engine/services/rule-engine.service.ts:45`)
   - Need to validate payment covers session time window
   
2. **Payment Reconciliation Trigger** (`src/ingestion/services/payment-ingestion.service.ts:31`)
   - Need to trigger session re-evaluation when payment arrives

### Technical Debt
1. **Database Synchronization:** Using TypeORM `synchronize: true` in non-production
   - Should implement proper migrations for production
   
2. **Decision Entity:** `params` field is incorrectly typed as `Date` (should be JSONB)
   - Line 46 in `decision.entity.ts`

3. **CORS Configuration:** Currently allows all origins (`origin: true`)
   - Should be restricted in production

4. **Image Storage:** Local filesystem storage
   - Consider cloud storage for production scalability

---

## Data Flow

### Current Flow
1. **ANPR Event** → `POST /ingestion/anpr`
2. **Movement Created** → Stored in `movements` table
3. **Session Service** → Processes movement (entry/exit logic)
4. **Session Created/Updated** → Stored in `sessions` table
5. **Rule Engine** → Evaluates completed sessions
6. **Decision Created** → Stored in `decisions` table
7. **Enforcement Queue** → ENFORCEMENT_CANDIDATE decisions appear in queue
8. **Operator Review** → Human review via frontend
9. **Decision Updated** → Status changed to APPROVED/DECLINED

### Missing Flows
- Payment/permits arriving after session completion (reconciliation)
- Real-time access control decisions
- Enforcement export/archival
- Batch processing for large datasets

---

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `sites` - Parking site configuration
- `movements` - ANPR camera events (immutable)
- `sessions` - Vehicle parking sessions
- `decisions` - Rule evaluation outcomes
- `payments` - Payment records
- `permits` - Whitelist/permit records
- `audit_logs` - System audit trail

### Indexes
- Movements: `(vrm, timestamp)`, `(siteId, timestamp)`
- Sessions: `(vrm, siteId)`, `(startTime)`
- Payments: `(vrm, siteId)`, `(expiryTime)`
- Permits: `(vrm)`

---

## Compliance & Audit

### Current State
- ✅ Audit logs created for operator actions

- Full audit trail for compliance

---

## Performance Considerations

### Current
- Basic database indexes in place
- No pagination limits enforced (API allows up to 50)
- Image storage on local filesystem

### Concerns
- No caching layer
- No rate limiting
- Image storage may not scale
- No query optimization for large datasets

---

## Security Considerations

### Current
- Basic CORS configuration
- No authentication/authorization implemented
- No input validation beyond DTOs
- Environment variables for sensitive data

### Needed
- Authentication system
- Role-based access control
- API rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- Secure image storage
- HTTPS enforcement

## Documentation Status

- ✅ Logical Operations Spec (`specs/logical_operations_spec.md`)
- ❌ API Documentation (needs creation)
- ❌ Development Guide (needs creation)
- ❌ Deployment Guide (needs creation)
- ⚠️ README (needs update with project-specific info)

## Summary

The Parking Operations System has a solid architectural foundation with core functionality working. The system can ingest ANPR events, create sessions, evaluate rules, and manage enforcement workflows. However, several critical features are incomplete, and the system lacks testing, proper production configuration, and some advanced features specified in the requirements.

**Production Readiness:** ⚠️ **Not Ready** - Requires testing, reconciliation logic, and production hardening.

**Development Status:** 🟡 **Active Development** - Core features functional, enhancements needed.
